# Open Augmentative and Alternative Communication

This project uses Generative AI to allow better communication with Neuro-atypical users via mobile devices.

The OpenAAC app will use Generative AI generate and the symbols from the [Open Symbols library](https://www.opensymbols.org/) to convert natural language to AAC pictograms.
